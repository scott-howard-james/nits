Nits
========================================

Nits is a collection of small convenience functions and classes,
primarily for simplifying python syntax and smoothing some (at least in
the opinon of the author) rough edges. Currently, it includes the
following:

-  Wrappers for basic text and CSV file handling
-  Date and time functions for converting to/from UNIX time
-  A factory class for general purpose type casting
